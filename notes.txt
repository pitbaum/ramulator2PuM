// Deleted all non DDR4 files from the make files
    Since otherwise the states wont match and all other standards are irrelevant

// Still have some remnant files from the deletion

// Addr translation
    Not using any address translation

// trace read
    Command (R,W,C,F,M) Address (int)
    Need to use "path" instead of "traces" for the trace file path in the yaml
